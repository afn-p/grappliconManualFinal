Grapplicon is intended to be a submission grappling online platform for managing the operations involved in tournaments and matches, as well as providing a standardization to belt rank promotions, under rules and procedures deviating from current approaches of today.

It is high hopes that Grapplicon will bring more attention to the wonderful sport of submission grappling, further making the activity accessible to anyone in the world.
